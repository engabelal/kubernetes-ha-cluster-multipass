# command that was generated during the 'kubeadm init' step on master01.

# 1. SSH into the worker node (worker01 or worker02) or use 'multipass exec'
# 2. Paste and run the 'kubeadm join' command for worker nodes.
#
# It will look something like this:
#
# sudo kubeadm join master01:6443 --token <your-token> \
#     --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:<your-hash>
