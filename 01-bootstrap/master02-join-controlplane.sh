# This script is a placeholder. You must run the actual 'kubeadm join'
# command that was generated during the 'kubeadm init' step on master01.

# 1. SSH into master02 or use 'multipass exec master02 -- bash'
# 2. Paste and run the full 'kubeadm join' command for the control plane.
#
# It will look something like this:
#
# sudo kubeadm join master01:6443 --token <your-token> \
#     --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:<your-hash> \
#     --control-plane --certificate-key <your-certificate-key>

echo "This is a placeholder script. Please run the 'kubeadm join' command from master01."
